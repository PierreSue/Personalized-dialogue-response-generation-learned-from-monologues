## Abstract
Personalized responses are essential for having an informative and human-like conversation. Because it is difficult to collect a large amount of dialogues involved with specific speakers, it is desirable that chatbot can learn to generate personalized responses simply from monologues of individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized dialogue generation method which reduces the training data requirement to dialogues without speaker information and monologues of every target speaker. In the proposed approach, a generative adversarial network ensures the responses containing recognizable personal characteristics of the target speaker, and a backward SEQ2SEQ model reconstructs the input message for keeping the coherence of the generated responses. The proposed model demonstrates its flexibility to respond to open-domain conversations, and the experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against prior work in coherence, personality classification, and human evaluation.
